This car prediction project aims to predict the prices of cars based on various features such as make, model, mileage, year of manufacture, and other relevant attributes. 
The project will utilize machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model that can estimate the price of a car given its features. 
By analyzing historical car data and applying regression techniques, the project seeks to provide accurate price predictions that can assist buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.
